SCADA HACKING: The project presented a comprehensive exploration of SCADA system vulnerabilities, simulated attacks, and potential threats. It outlined a risk reduction methodology, emphasizing elapsed time for successful attacks. The outcomes included detailed documentation of vulnerabilities, proof-of-concept exploits, and actionable insights for enhancing SCADA security. The project's real-world applicability extends to informing policy decisions and shaping industry best practices. It identified limitations such as cybersecurity risks, interoperability challenges, and human factors. Future enhancements aim to refine the compromise graph model and develop a user-friendly tool for risk analysis and secure system design, contributing to a more resilient SCADA infrastructure.
As a group of 5 members we have been working on: Gathering info online about scada devies Developing attack methodology to target plc devices Mapping the attack surface by threat actor We would be making a project based on techniques used by Threat Actors to target the SCADA Devices like PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers). Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
